  "faq_answer1": "CoinView Today is an AI-powered platform that extracts and analyzes sentiment from YouTube video content, aimed at helping users predict and analyze overall trends in the cryptocurrency market. Our core feature lies in utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to provide real-time, accurate sentiment analysis by interpreting YouTube creators’ opinions and market sentiment. In addition to summarizing the insights from multiple market analysts, the platform also provides you with daily Bitcoin prices, the Fear and Greed Index, and daily rise/fall probabilities, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date and comprehensive market information.",
  "faq_question2": "Is the sentiment analysis data from YouTube videos reliable and timely?",
  "faq_answer2": "We leverage advanced AI technology, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform detailed analysis of video content. The content is translated into both Chinese and English, and the system ultimately provides a bullish, bearish, or neutral market sentiment with detailed reasoning. Our real-time analysis is typically completed within 5 to 10 minutes after the video is posted by the creator. Premium members also receive real-time notifications via email and Telegram, ensuring you stay updated on market trends as they happen.",

However, free users can only view the video analysis results of 4 analysts recommended by the platform’s algorithm on the homepage. In contrast, premium users can customize and track up to 10 or 50 preferred analysts and access detailed statistical reports in the dashboard to monitor their accuracy. Additionally, premium users will receive video sentiment analysis results via Telegram immediately after the analysts release their content, ensuring timely insights into market trends.",

If you need to track more creators, you can choose the Enterprise Plan to track up to 50 creators. Once upgraded to a paid membership, you will be able to automatically track your selected creators in a table format on the dashboard, and even export the data to an Excel report for further analysis.",
  "faq_question6": "What should I do if I encounter an issue while using the platform?",
  "faq_answer6": "If you encounter any issues while using the platform, you can visit our “FAQ” page for potential solutions, or contact us via email at contact@coinview.today.

  "faq_question7": "What type of subscription service can premium members receive after linking their Telegram account?",
